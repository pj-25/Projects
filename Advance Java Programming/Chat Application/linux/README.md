## About Gossip

The Gossip is Java Chat application  which will be launched from the command line. The Users can run on  computer from anywhere in internet, `e.g. Wide  Area Network (WAN)`.

There can be multiple users connect to a  server and they can chat to each other, unlike chat room user can see only the messages forwarded to him/her. Thereâ€™s  private chat between  two users.

Before getting connected to the server, a user must provide his or her name to enter the Application. The currently active user's list will be displayed on the user's interactive window for simplicity.

Every user is will  be updated when a new user arrives and when a user has gone. 

And finally, the user will close the window to quit the chat. And server will automatically remove that user from the active users list.
